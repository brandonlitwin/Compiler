# Compiler
This is my Compiler Project written in TypeScript. These intructions will describe how to deploy the code.

# Setup TypeScript/Gulp
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install npm. I am using v5.6. Then, run these commands in the `Compiler` directory: 
3. Run `npm init`
4. Run `npm install typescript` to get the TypeScript compiler. I am using v3.2.4 
5. Run `npm install gulp` to get the Gulp Task Runner. I am using v4.0.0
6. Run `npm install gulp-tsc` to get the Gulp TypeScript plugin. I am using v1.3.2

# Using Gulp
Run `gulp` in the `Compiler` directory to have it start watching for changes in the .ts files in the source/scripts directory as well as .css files in the source/styles directory.

# Using the Compiler
Open `index.html` in your browser of choice to see the compiler and interact with it!
